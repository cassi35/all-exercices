# All Exercises

Welcome to the **All Exercises** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various data structure and algorithm exercises in JavaScript. These exercises are sourced from popular coding challenge websites such as HackerRank, Edabit, GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the source of the exercises:

- **leetcode/**: Solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **problems/**: Contains subdirectories for different websites:
  - **adventocode/**: Solutions to Advent of Code challenges.
  - **codewars/**: Solutions to Codewars challenges.
  - **eddabit/**: Solutions to Edabit challenges.
  - **exercism/**: Solutions to Exercism challenges.
  - **geeksforgeeks/**: Solutions to GeeksforGeeks challenges.
  - **hackerEarth/**: Solutions to HackerEarth challenges.
  - **hackerhank/**: Solutions to HackerRank challenges.
  - **javascript/**: General JavaScript exercises and data structure implementations.

## How to Use

Each directory contains JavaScript files with solutions to specific problems. You can navigate through the directories to find the solutions you are interested in. Each file is named according to the problem it solves, and the functions within the files are documented with comments to explain their purpose and usage.

## Running the Code

To run any of the solutions, you can use Node.js. For example, to run a solution from the `leetcode` directory, use the following command:

```sh
node leetcode/leetcode1.js
